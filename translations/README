README FOR TRANSLATORS

1)
Copy file po/plasma_applet_panon.pot

2)
Rename it to plasma_applet_panon_$LANG.po
- where $LANG is desired language, e.g. "pl" (or locale, e.g. "en_GB")

3)
In the copied file:
- change Language accordingly
- be sure to write your name :-) (as Last-Translator and Language-Team)

4)
To "debug" the translation without changing your system language:
1. Execute kde/translations/install_translations.sh 
2. Prepend these lines to kde/test.sh and run it.
```bash
LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
# Replace en_US with your language.
```bash

Thank You for your translations!
